## Summary:
This is a personal project documenting my journey in creating a personalized desktop pet robot. It provides some key insights into product design, programming, prototyping, electronics, product testing, project management, and Artificial Intelligence. I envision this project to evolve as I learn new things from exploring all these key insights while also highlight some of the challenges faced. 

## Project Stages:
### 1. Analysis: Robot's Face, Body Components, Functionalities, Features, Motivation & Inspiration
At this stage, I plan to create the robot's literal facial component using a display that shows the robot's eyes. In order to achieve this, I watched [FluxGarage's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@FluxGarage) for inspiration and my starting point in doing this project.

(To be updated..)

### 2. Planning: Hardware and Software
