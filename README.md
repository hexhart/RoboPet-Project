## Summary:
This is a personal project documenting my journey in creating a personalized desktop pet robot. It provides some key insights into product design, programming, prototyping, electronics, product testing, project management, and Artificial Intelligence. I envision this project to evolve as I learn new things from exploring all these key insights while also highlight some of the challenges faced. 

## Project Stages:
### 1. Analysis: Creation of the Robot's Face, Components, Functionalities, Features, etc
At this stage, I plan to create the robot's literal facial component using a display that shows the robot's eyes. In order to achieve this, I watched [FluxGarage's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@FluxGarage) for inspiration and my starting point in doing this project.

(To be updated..)

### 2. Planning and Design: Assembling components, Wiring diagrams, 3D Modelling, etc.
#### Hardware Requirements:
  - OLED & TFT Display
  - Jumper Wires
  - Breadboard
  - Arduino Nano
  - ESP23-S3 Mini Development Board
  - Tri-Axis Digital Tilt Sensor
  - Touch Sensor
  - ToF
  - Speakers
  - Mic & SoundBoardNote: To be added..

#### Software Installation (IDE):
  - Download and Install [Arduino IDE](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/360019833020-Download-and-install-Arduino-IDE)
